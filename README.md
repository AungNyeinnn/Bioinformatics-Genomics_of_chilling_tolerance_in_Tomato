Chilling tolerance is an important trait for tomato, especially in regions with fluctuating or cool temperatures. Understanding the genetic basis of chilling tolerance can help in breeding more resilient tomato varieties.

Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) are regions of the genome that are associated with specific traits, such as chilling tolerance. This project uses QTL package in R to analyze genetic data and identify QTLs associated with chilling tolerance in tomato.
